# React Hooks
(Normal JS Utility Functions)
 - useState()
 - useEffect()
 (80% vs 20% usage)

# useState() -- Superpowerful State variables in react. 



# Routing in Web Apps.
1. Client Side routing.
2. Server Side Routing.

Server side routing -- It will do network call and bring that required page (old way). Will take some time and reload.

Client Side routing - All the components are already loaded. Routing will just change the component. Check the Network tab in Edge, chrome. Here the React app only do the Api call.
